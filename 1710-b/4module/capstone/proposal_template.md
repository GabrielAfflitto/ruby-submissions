### Project Template

### [Project Title]

### Pitch

1-3 sentences that explains the value proposition of the application. How would you explain it to a potential business partner, team member, or investor?

I would like to make an application that allows users to review hip hop albums. This application would be similar to a Rotten Tomatoes platform, in which users can add reviews to movies on the fly. If the album they want to review is not there, they can create a new record and add a review.

### Problem

1-3 sentences describing the problem that you are trying to solve.  

There is no real platform for fans of hip hop to interact with one another and review music and have discussions, other than the youtube comment section. So this application would provide that platform completely user run and without corporate influence on album reviews to sell records


### Solution

1-3 sentences describing how your application will solve that problem.  




### MVP

What is your MVP? Be very specific about what pieces of functionality will be in place.

* Must have MVP: User will be able to search for hip hop albums and write reviews. Logged in users will be able to see reviews made. If album is not found, users can create their own record.

* Hope to reach (beyond my initial MVP):

add youtube api or spotify api functionality so users can get samples of songs.


### Target Audience

1-3 sentences describing what type of user your app would be applicable to.  

Fans of music, specifically fans of hip hop


### New Technologies

Which new technologies will you implement?  

JS, React, new APIs, maybe graphql
